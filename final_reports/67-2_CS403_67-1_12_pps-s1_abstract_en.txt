E-TESTING SYSTEM
	In the era of rapidly advancing digital technology, education is one of the areas 
significantly impacted. Most online examination systems primarily focus on evaluating 
results through scores, where test-takers are often provided only with overall scores 
without receiving in-depth feedback to guide them on what to further study or which 
topics to prioritize for improving their understanding. This limitation prevents 
students from clearly identifying areas or topics that require further knowledge 
development. To address this issue, an online examination application has been 
developed with the aim of enhancing students' learning effectively. The application 
features a system that identifies areas where students should focus on further study 
by providing content-based feedback rather than emphasizing test scores alone.
